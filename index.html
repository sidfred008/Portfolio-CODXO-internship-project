                    <td><p class = "aboutme"><b>I was born on 8th October in the year 2006 in Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, located in Rajinder Nagar, New Delhi. I was fond of sciences and mathematics since my childhood days specially in astronomy and space science related stuff. However over the course of time I lost my interest in it due to growing and exploring more options 
                    available in front of me. It was in the year 2017 only that my interest in science and mathematics started to deteriorate because of an altogether change in the syllabus and I was not able to cope up well with what was going on around me. In 2018, I just barely passed my grade 7th annual examinations with the report card stating, "Promoted on Condition, needs improvement in Mathematics". I was shocked to see this and it was then that I decided that I wanted to 
                    work hard from grade 8th onwards. However, due to many reasons again I lost my interest and my results again went down.<br><br> But I don't know how it all happened that I once again motivated myself to give it an attempt and I started studying and working harder day and night to pass my grade 8th examination. In the course of time, I also developed interest in both the subjects again and finally I passed my 8th grade with flying colors ( I mean improved a lot ). During the COVID times, I decided that I wanted to go for Engineering
                    and for 2 years i.e. grade 9th and 10th I studied both the subjects with sheer dedication. I passed my CBSE grade 10th board examinations in 2022 with 88.6% overall. I took PCM with Computer Sciences in grade 11th so that I can appear for JEE mains and Advanced.<br><br>
                    The same year I also became the head boy of my school. But, juggling the role of being a student and head boy at school and a student at a coaching centre was taking a lot of toll on my studies because of which I again lost my interest in these 3 subjects. I was on backlogs, I gave up my preparation for Engineering and hired private tutors just to pass my grade 11th exams. But apart from everything there was this one subject that
                    kept pestering me a lot and because of which a I fell in a state of trepidation whether I'll clear my grade 11th or not. And that was Computer Science!! However, when I entered grade 12th alongside with Python I was introduced to MySQL. Studying this Database Language also allowed me to work harder in Python and because of which I sort of started to develop interest in this subject. It was then that very moment I decided to switch my career goals from Engineering to Computer Science.
                    At the same time during the last months before our board exams I worked hard whatever I could in all 5 subjects to clear my grade 12th with a good score that can also guarantee me with a scholarship at the universities that I applied to study BSc (hons) Computer Science with Cybersecurity. By God's grace, I passed my CBSE AISSE class 12th with 81.2% and also did receive a scholarship from the universities that I have applied for.</b></p></td>

It was created using Python and MySQL and the objective of this project was to create an awareness among users and clients that how big data can get and how unreliable it would be to stick with the older methods of storing data which can be kept at threat and may get mismanaged and lost. 
            Using such software and database from which you can easily access the data and manage and edit can be much more efficient in a fast paced working environment.</p><br><br><img src = "2024-06-26T08_51_46.png" class = "projectimage_1" alt = "projectimage1" height = "400px" width = "800px"></li><br>

            I specifically made this one because it was because of Mark Zuckerberg ( whom I look up to as one of my inspirations ) only that I developed a passion and obsession for learning web development. I created this project using the basics of HTML5 and CSS3 and it also gave me an insight about what all things are still left for me to learn in web development that I have now incorporated those learnings here in this portfolio now.</p><br><br><iframe class = "video" src = "clideo_editor_b6942c83145b402ba2a260e9de16d015.mp4" height = "350px" width = "500px"></iframe></li>
